# ember-cli-deploy-dist-dir

This plugin is for setting distDir and distFiles context parameters when not using the ember-cli-deploy-build plugin. This allows you to utilize plugins that rely on ember-cli-deploy-build when you are building your app outside of the deploy pipeline.

## Installation

* ember install ember-cli-deploy-dist-dir
